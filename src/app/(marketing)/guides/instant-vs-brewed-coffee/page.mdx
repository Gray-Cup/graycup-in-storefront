Instant coffee gets a bad reputation. For years it was synonymous with weak, bitter, chemical-tasting drinks served at office meetings. That's changed significantly. At the same time, brewed coffee has never been more accessible. So which should you be drinking?

The honest answer: it depends on what you're looking for.

## What Is Instant Coffee?

Instant coffee starts as brewed coffee. The liquid is either **spray-dried** (hot air evaporates the water, leaving behind fine powder) or **freeze-dried** (the brewed coffee is frozen into slabs, then the ice is removed under vacuum, leaving granules intact).

Freeze-dried instant coffee preserves more volatile aromatics — which is why freeze-dried products often taste noticeably better than spray-dried ones.

You dissolve it in hot or cold water (or milk), and you're done. No equipment, no mess, no waiting.

## What Is Brewed Coffee?

Brewed coffee involves forcing hot water through ground coffee beans. The most common methods:

- **Filter / Pour-over** — hot water poured through ground coffee and a filter
- **French press** — grounds steep in water, then are pressed to the bottom
- **Moka pot** — pressurised steam pushes water through grounds on the stovetop
- **Espresso machine** — high-pressure water through finely ground coffee
- **Cold brew** — coarse grounds steeped in cold water for 12–24 hours

Each method produces a different flavour profile. The common thread: fresh grounds, ground close to brewing time, make significantly better coffee.

## The Honest Flavour Comparison

Good brewed coffee from quality beans has layers — acidity, sweetness, body, and aroma — that are genuinely complex. Even a simple pour-over with freshly ground beans will be noticeably more flavourful than most instant options.

Instant coffee, even good instant coffee, loses some of those volatile aromatics during processing. The high heat of spray-drying in particular damages the compounds responsible for brightness and complexity.

That said, **quality instant coffee is genuinely good**. Modern freeze-dried products from specialty roasters are miles ahead of what was available a decade ago. They make a solid cup — especially when you need one fast, are travelling, or are making an iced coffee drink where the coffee is diluted with milk and sugar anyway.

## Convenience vs Quality

This is the real trade-off.

**Instant coffee** wins on:
- Speed (30 seconds, no equipment)
- Portability (take it anywhere)
- Consistency (same result every time)
- No cleanup
- Lower cost per cup in many cases

**Brewed coffee** wins on:
- Flavour depth and complexity
- Freshness
- Control over strength and extraction
- The experience of the ritual itself

## When Instant Makes Sense

- Early mornings when you need caffeine, not ceremony
- Travel, camping, or anywhere equipment isn't practical
- Iced lattes and coffee-based drinks where coffee is one ingredient among many
- Office situations where a full brew setup isn't available

## When to Brew

- When the coffee itself is what you're tasting
- Weekend mornings with time to spare
- When you've invested in good beans and want to get the most from them
- When you're developing a palate for coffee flavour differences

There's no wrong answer here. A good instant coffee in the right moment beats mediocre brewed coffee from stale beans. Know what you're optimising for — and keep both on hand.
